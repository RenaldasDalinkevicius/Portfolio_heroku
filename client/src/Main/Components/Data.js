            aboutOther: "At first i was overwhelmed, it truly did seem impossible, but i pushed through. What was most helpful, was not siting through 10 hour videos on how to make a website, but actually just trying to do things yourself, looking at stackoverflow for how to do certain things, so you end up having a vague idea on how things actually work."
